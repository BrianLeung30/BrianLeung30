Hello! Welcome to Brian's page about Brian!

I'm Brian. I am a junior at Washington State University majoring in Computer Science. I find peace in programming. I think it takes so much 
focus to write good code that it makes me forget about all the worries in life... or maybe coding IS the worry in my life. I live by the moto
"There is no errors that a can of Monster energy can't fix".

I take pride in understanding the details of how everything works. Since the first time I ever signed a contract, I have been in love with reading the fineprints.
I think it makes me a better programmer, or maybe it's justification for my recently aquired addiction to caffine.
